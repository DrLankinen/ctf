Description:
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate. You can download the challenge files here:
[challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_rhea/21/challenge.zip)

Solution:
1. `wget <url to challenge.zip>`
1. `unzip challenge.zip`
1. `cd home/ctf-player/drop-in`
1. The challenge.zip contains a checksum file and a folder with 301 files.
1. `sha256sum files/* | grep <checksum.txt content>` finds a file that's checksum matches to the given flag checksum
1. `./decrypt.sh files/<the matching file from the previous command>`
